  title : We're here to support your success
  content : In 2016, I left the employed world to set up a consultancy that would help people adopt data science. Unfortunately, I only have so many hours in the day! Nightingale is my solution to that problem -- whilst I'm asleep or helping clients, organisations can leverage my knowledge, that of my consultants, and that of other great partners around the world.
