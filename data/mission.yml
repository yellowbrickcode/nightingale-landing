    title : Why Nightingale?
    description : Florence Nightingale is best known as a nurse. She helped a tremendous amount of people with her efforts during a war. What's less known about Florence is that she was one of the first data scientists. She applied statistics and uncovered techniques and mechanisms in medicine that have since saved countless lives. Florence was an accomplished woman who used her skills to help others. We'd love for Nightingale to achieve even a percent of how much good Florence achieved.
